# WordLadder
A word ladder program to find the shortest distance between two words.
I modeled this problem as a graph to be able to utilize graph algorithms, BFS in this case, 
to find the shortest distance between adjacent words.
Words are adjacent if they are separated by a one letter operation(substitution, removal and insertion).
A sample dictionary of 4900 words has been included in the files however, one would be able to use their own dictionary should
they choose to do so.
